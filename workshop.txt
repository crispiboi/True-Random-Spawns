description=True Random Spawns
description=This mod will spawn you literally anywhere on the map. It works via a preconfigured list of map cells and filters them based on your selection, teleports you to the selection , and attempts to validate the square (ie in doors, on water, in a doorless room).
description=
description=There are sandbox options which can change the difficulty by chosing spawns atleast in a building, near civilization, near a road, near a wildnerness camp, in the wildnerness, or anywhere. There is a sandbox option to select the general area you spawn in as well, defaulting to anywhere.
description=
description=Since this is an early alpha testing relaase I have left alot of debugging in the code including the f9 key to reroll a spawn.
description=
description=This probably will not work in multiplayer.
description=
description=There are approximately 26 million possible spawns near civilization, and 100 million possible spawns in the mod. (Calc by 300x300x(count of cells))
